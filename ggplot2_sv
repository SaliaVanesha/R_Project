# R Code for "Create a Plot in ggplot2" Activity
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 1: Install necessary packages
# You only need to run these lines ONCE. If you have already installed them,
# you can skip this step or leave the lines commented out.
 install.packages("ggplot2")
 install.packages("palmerpenguins")


# Step 2: Load the packages into your R session
# You need to run this every time you start a new R session.
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)


# Step 3: Examine the penguins data frame
# The data() function is not strictly necessary but is good practice to explicitly load the data.
data(penguins) 

# Use View() to open the dataset in a new tab in RStudio (like a spreadsheet).
# Note the capital "V".
View(penguins)

# You can also use head() to see the first few rows directly in the console.
head(penguins)


# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4: Create the scatterplot
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# This code creates a plot showing the relationship between flipper length and body mass.
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

# --- Code Breakdown ---
#
# ggplot(data = penguins): This initializes the plot and specifies the dataset we are using.
#
# + : The plus sign is used to add new layers to the plot.
#
# geom_point(): This is the geometric object (geom) layer. It tells ggplot to represent
#               the data as points, creating a scatterplot.
#
# mapping = aes(...): This describes the aesthetic mappingsâ€”how variables from the data
#                     are connected to visual properties of the plot.
#
# x = flipper_length_mm: Maps the 'flipper_length_mm' column to the x-axis.
# y = body_mass_g:       Maps the 'body_mass_g' column to the y-axis.


# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pro-Tip: Alternative syntax
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can also place the mapping argument inside the main ggplot() function.
# This is useful if all subsequent geom layers will use the same aesthetics.
# The code below produces the exact same plot as the one above.

# ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
#   geom_point()
