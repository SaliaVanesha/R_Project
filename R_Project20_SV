# --- Lesson 4: Annotations and Saving ---

# This script demonstrates how to annotate and save plots using the ggplot2 package
# with the 'hotel_bookings.csv' dataset.

# --- Step 1: Import your data ---
# Load the dataset from the specified CSV file into a data frame.
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")


# --- Step 2: Refresh Your Memory ---
# Get a quick overview of the data structure and column names.

# Preview the first few rows of the data frame.
head(hotel_bookings)

# List all column names in the data frame.
colnames(hotel_bookings)


# --- Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package ---
# Note: You only need to run install.packages() once.
# If ggplot2 is already installed, you can comment out the first line.
# install.packages('ggplot2')

# Load the ggplot2 library to make its functions available for use.
library(ggplot2)


# --- Step 4: Annotating your chart ---
# This section walks through adding titles, captions, and labels to a plot.

# First, create the initial faceted bar chart.
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel)

# Add a main title to the plot using the labs() function.
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings")

# To add a dynamic date range, first find the earliest and latest years in the data.
mindate <- min(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)
maxdate <- max(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)

# Add a subtitle to display the data's time period.
# The paste0() function combines text and variables without spaces.
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings",
       subtitle = paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate))

# Change the subtitle to a caption, which is placed in the bottom-right corner.
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings",
       caption = paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate))

# Finally, clean up the x and y axis labels for better clarity.
# This is the final version of the plot before saving.
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings",
       caption = paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate),
       x = "Market Segment",
       y = "Number of Bookings")


# --- Step 5: Saving your chart ---
# The ggsave() function saves the most recently displayed ggplot.

# Save the plot with default settings (e.g., default size, last plot).
# The file will be named 'hotel_booking_chart.png' and saved in your working directory.
ggsave('hotel_booking_chart.png')

# Save the plot with custom dimensions to make it wider for a presentation.
# Here, we specify a width of 16 inches and a height of 8 inches.
ggsave('hotel_booking_chart.png',
       width = 16,
       height = 8)
